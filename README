This plugin pops up a window which enables the user to create boxes with 
the full range of HTML borders, font selection and font size, screen positioning
for box.  Borders and fonts can be sized.  All elements
can use foreground and, where applicable, background colors.

To use this plugin, you can select the text or add text after the box has
been created. You can add images to these boxes but their positons depend
on their Dokuwiki markup.
