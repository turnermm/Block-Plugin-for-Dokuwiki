This plugin pops up a window which enables the user to create boxes with 
the full range of HTML borders, font selection and font size, screen positioning
for box and included text.  Borders and fonts can be sized.  All elements
can use foreground and, where applicable, background colors.

To use this plugin, you can select the text or add text after the box has
been created.  Text can be aligned.  However, images cannot; their alignment
depends on standard Dokuwiki image alignment markup.
